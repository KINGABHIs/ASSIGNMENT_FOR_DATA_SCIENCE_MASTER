    "A Decision Tree Classifier is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by splitting the data into subsets based on feature values, creating a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, branches represent possible outcomes, and leaf nodes represent the final class label.\n",

    "1. Root Node Selection:The algorithm starts at the root node, which contains the entire dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Splitting the Data:The dataset is divided into subsets based on the chosen feature‚Äôs values.\n",
    "Each split aims to maximize the purity of the resulting subsets (i.e., each subset should ideally contain only one class).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Recursive Partitioning:The process of splitting continues recursively for each subset, creating child nodes.\n",
    "This process stops when a stopping condition is met (e.g., all data in a node belong to one class, or a maximum tree depth is reached).\n",
